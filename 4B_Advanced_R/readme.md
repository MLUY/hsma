# Session 4B Advanced R
## ggplot2, fitdistrplus and R-Shiny

This session on advanced uses of R introduces the libraries ggplot2, fitdistrplus and Shiny. Each of the packages is introduced in a generic way providing you with the understanding needed to continue your learning on your own. Plotting with ggplot2 is introduced and the grammar of graphics explained follwed by a plotting task. A generic distribution fitting framework using fitdistrplus is then described followed by a task using this framework. Finally R-Shiny is introduced using several simplified examples. A task to construct a distribution fitting tool in Shiny finishes the session.

All of the materials for the session can be found within this folder.

To code along with the presentation/video and do the exercises you will need to install the following dependencies:
* ggplot2
* fitdistrplus
* shiny
* actuar

You can either manually install these in RStudio or use the install packages line below in the console:
* install.packages(c(ggplot2,fitdistrplus,shiny,actuar))
