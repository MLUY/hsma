# Session 8C Advanced Network Analysis 2
## Graph Visualisation
This folder contains the materials for session 8C Advanced network analysis 2. In the session we cover:
* The visual parameters that can be used to represent data in a network
* Visualising a network with NetworkX in python
* Visualising a network with Holoviews in python
* Using NetworkX and Holoviews together to include graph metrics in the visualisation
* Visualising a network using Gephi (open source software)

For this session you will require the following python packages:
* networkx - conda install -c anaconda networkx
* pyviz, holoviews and bokeh - conda install -c pyviz holoviews bokeh
* matplotlib and plotly - conda install matplotlib plotly
* pandas - conda install pandas

**Note: some of these packages will be available by default if using conda**

For the session you will also need to install a standalone software package called Gephi which can be downloaded from https://gephi.org/
