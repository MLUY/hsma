    "We can see a number of things from the above plot.  We see not only the POS tags for each word, but also how the words are dependent on each other.  For example, we see that \"Tableau\" acts a passive nominal subject in this sentence (Tableau is the \"subject\" of the sentence - the entity to which the verb is being (or in this case, has been) done), that \"Salesforce\" acts as an object of preposition (Salesforce is an object because it is the thing that is (or, here, was) doing the verb), and that the two halves of the sentence are linked by the verb \"acquired\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to extract the relationship in the text above, we need to be able to identify the relevant subject and object of the sentence.  Let's write a function that takes as its input a SpaCy document.  This function will iterate through all the tokens in the input document, and check to see if the token has a dependency tag that contains \"subjpass\" (passive subject) such as 'nsubjpass' (nominal subject (passive)) (remember you can use spacy.explain to look up POS and dependency tags such as 'nsubjpass').  If it does, it will store the text of the token in y.  It will then iterate through all of the tokens to look for an object (there are different types of object, so this will look for any dependency tags that end with \"obj\"). Once it finds one, it will store the text of the token in x.  The function will then return both x (the object) and y (the passive subject).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - this function will only work properly if there is one object and one passive subject (so realistically a single sentence).  More than one object or passive subject would cause only the last one in the text to be returned. So this would need adapting if that's what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nominal is a word or group of words that function together as a noun. A nominal gives more specific details than a simple noun.  E.g. \"nice cup of tea\" is an example of a nominal - it gives more description than the head noun (cup) - we now know that it is a cup filled with tea, and that it is nice.  See https://www.thoughtco.com/nominal-in-grammar-1691431 \n",
    "\n",
    "Because nominals function as nouns, they can do whatever nouns can - be a subject, an object or a predictive nominative. A nominal subject (passive) is therefore one in which the nominal is acting as the thing to which the action is being done.  In our example sentence \"Tableau was recently acquired by Salesforce\", Tableau is a nominal subject passive ('nsubjpass') because it is the thing to which the action of acquiring was being done."

    "This time we find a new problem - here we've got a single subject (Father) but two objects (victim and meal). Looking at the dependency tree / tags, we see that victim has a tag of \"dobj\" and meal has a tage of \"pobj\".  \"dobj\" is a Direct Object - this is one that answers the question \"whom?\" or \"what?\" after an action verb.  So in this case, the father \"took\" - and who did he take?  The victim.  Therefore, victim is the Direct Object.  \"pobj\" is an Object of Preposition - this is one that answers \"whom?\" or \"what?\" after a preposition in a prepositional phrase.  Remember, a preposition governs a noun or pronoun to express a relation with another element in the clause (words such as by, to, at etc). In this case, the preposition is \"for\" - it identifies the reason why the father took the victim out (for a meal).  So, the Object of Preposition here is \"meal\" - it's the object in the prepositional phrase. See : https://webapps.towson.edu/ows/nouns.htm\n",

    "So, our simple function above won't cut the mustard, because there are two objects here, and so the last one in the sentence (in this case, the object of preposition) would be returned as THE object.  But in reality, we probably want the direct object, or at least to be able to choose between them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's rewrite our function again.  Here, rather than returning a single subject and a single object, we return a list of subjects and objects.  For the list of objects, we actually return a list of tuples, where the first element of the tuple is the text of the token identified as an object, and the second is the dependency tag, so we can identify what type of object it is.  This would allow us, for example, to filter only direct objects, if that is all we're interested in."
